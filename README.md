# BFpack

R-functions for Bayesian exploratory and confirmatory hypothesis testing for the most commonly used statistical models, including (but not limited to) univariate/multivariate t testing, (M)AN(C)OVA, multivariate/univariate regression, structural equation modeling, (mixed) generalized linear models. The functions need fitted models (e.g., lm) as input as well as a string that specifies a set of order constraints on the regression coefficients.
